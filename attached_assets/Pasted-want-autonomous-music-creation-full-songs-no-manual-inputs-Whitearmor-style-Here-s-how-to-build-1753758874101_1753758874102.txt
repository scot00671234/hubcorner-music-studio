want autonomous music creation — full songs, no manual inputs. Whitearmor style. Here's how to build it:

🎯 GOAL:
One click → Software generates a full song (2–3 min) in the style of Whitearmor: dreamy, off-grid, ambient, emotional.

💻 TECH STACK (Minimum Setup)
Layer	Tool
Model	MusicGen (by Meta), Riffusion, Jukebox (for raw audio), or MIDI transformer (custom)
Backend	Python (for inference)
Frontend	Electron or React + Node
Sound Engine	Web Audio API OR render offline and play final MP3/WAV

⚙️ HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS (FULL FLOW)
1. Mood/Prompt Module (optional)
Input: user types “Bladee floating in dreamscape”

OR: system randomizes from a predefined list

2. Structure Engine
Generates basic arrangement:

Intro (ambient)

Verse (soft beat enters)

Hook (heavier reverb + pitched vocals)

Bridge (filtered sounds)

Outro (repeats and fades)

Can be rule-based logic.

3. Music Generator
Choose your method:

Option A: Text-to-Audio AI
Use MusicGen (best open-source option now)

Feed prompt: "dreamy ambient trap beat, distorted, reverb-heavy, slow bpm"

Generate full-length WAV/MP3

[Can run locally or via Hugging Face]

Option B: Symbolic Composition (MIDI)
Train transformer (like MusicTransformer) on MIDI dataset of dreamy beats

Compose drum patterns, melodies, and pads

Use synth engine (like Tone.js or FluidSynth) to turn into audio

Stack with auto-FX

4. FX Layer
Apply DSP effects:

Reverb (long tail, shimmer)

Delay (unsynced, reversed)

Pitch shifting

Lo-fi filters / tape wobble

Randomized automation curves for realism

Use Web Audio API, Supercollider, or render offline with Python DSP libs.

5. Final Output
Auto-normalize volume

Export full WAV or MP3

Option to export stems

🔥 BONUS: TRAIN YOUR OWN AI
Train MusicGen on:

Whitearmor/Drain Gang instrumentals (YouTube rips → stem separation → audio chunks)

Label with mood tags like "foggy," "floating," "heartbroken"

You'll get custom dream-beat generation, closer to Whitearmor style than generic trap.

✅ MVP TO-DO (Solo Dev Plan)
Install MusicGen locally

Create frontend with one button: “Generate Song”

Set hardcoded prompt: "dreamy ambient trap beat, slow BPM, heavy reverb"

Render MP3 + play in browser

Optional: generate new song every X seconds
